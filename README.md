# sudoku-solver
This is a Python-based Sudoku solver that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Pygame. The application allows users to interactively solve Sudoku puzzles by entering numbers into the grid or by letting the program solve it automatically using recursive calls and a backtracking algorithm.
